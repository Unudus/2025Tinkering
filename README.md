bundled projects, tutorials and small code tinkers, as part of staying fresh &amp; hands on. Likely left unfinished &amp; messy

## Rolling commentary

Just to keep sane during the fun of setup, I'm going to capture some thoughts in a rough, rolling format, but I'll separate out language specifics to help future me

### General

* WSL2 is much better than a few years ago, but it feels like every tutorial starts off with a dependacy assumed. Just getting to something routine like a vanilla Laravel install was hours of catching errors from stale install steps
    * it's also a brain melter sometimes with docker. Turtles all the way down
* VSC is solid, but after years of using the Atalassian IDEs I miss scratchpads more than I thought. Also it didn't have autosave on by default
* Wow markdown completely fell out my head, these rolling notes will be a nice way of reminding myself of at least hte basics
* 1st Project, as they often do, turned into a side exercise/refresher in docker. [This](* Quickly turned into a side refresher on the joys of docker and system setup. [This](https://medium.com/@victoria.kruczek_15509/create-a-local-database-with-docker-compose-and-view-it-in-mysql-workbench-974aee047874) guide was handy) was handy and I'll likely reuse as future exercises get containerised
    * One I forget : think about if you want to let docker manage its own volume or create an explicit host-system-dir thats mounted for persistent data
* fun gotcha Postman was ignoring the proxy, causing localhost/ to return an old partially configured apache setup. It's simple enough to expliclity proxy via localhost though
