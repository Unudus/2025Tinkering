repos specifically around brushing up on whats happening with PHP, tinkering etc

## Side note

After messing around with ChatGPT, I asked it the following (after giving it my CV in markdown for context)

>  I want you to create 3 crash courses on programming ( language/Framework knowledge & experience, and practice). One for PHP, one for Whatever Javascript/Typescript framework is in the most job listings, and one for C#. The outcome should be knowledge of all applicable events for the language ( rise of popular tools, style of programming being popular etc ) and sufficient code I could upload to somewhere like github to show competence

>Expansion prompt : I don't want to do it with you now, I want courses with external learning resources I can follow. Each crash course should be complete-able within a 40hour window ( i.e. a work week )

This is what it gave me back
